# availabilityBiasTest
This project can be a test for availability bias (The Art of Thinking Clearly)

Simply input a letter, and input a position. This program will count the number of words starting with the inputted letter and count the words with that letter in the inputted position. Availability bias states that since words that start with the letter are more easily accessed by our brains, we are likely to fall under the illusion that the number of words starting with that letter will be greater than words with that letter in another position.

This project makes use of a dictionary of words that I downloaded from another github user, and is just a simple project that we can use to test our availabilty biasðŸ˜™
